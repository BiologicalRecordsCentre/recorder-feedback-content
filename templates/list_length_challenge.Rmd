# Hello `r params$user_name`!

Thanks for submitting your recent `r taxon` records!

## Why record species 'lists'?

Recording as many species as possible provides scientists with valuable insights into the biodiversity of a given area. When we talk about species 'lists', we're referring to documenting more than just one or two striking or easily noticeable speciesâ€”it's about observing and recording as many different species as you can find in a location.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
if(group >2){
  print(h2("Your recent lists"))
  
    
  print(p(paste0("Last week, you recorded an average of ",round(avg_list_length)," species per list. The longest list you submitted had ",max_list_length ," species.")))

  print(ggplot(max_list_length_df,aes(x = date,y = max_length))+
    geom_col(fill = "#92A41A")+
    theme_minimal(base_size = 18) +
    labs(x = "Date", y = "Longest list length")+
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = 'day', 
              date_labels = '%a')+
    geom_hline(yintercept = taxon_target,alpha= 1,linewidth = 2,colour = "red")+
    #annotate("text",x = Sys.Date()-4,y = 3,label = "List length target",colour = "red",size = 6)+
    lims(y = c(0,max(max_list_length,taxon_target+2))))
  

  
  if(max_list_length>=taxon_target){
    print(p(paste0("ðŸ¥³ Well done, you achieved the challenge of submitting a list with ",taxon_target," or more species!")))
  } else {
    print(p(paste0("ðŸ˜¢ Unfortunately, you didnâ€™t achieve the challenge of submitting a list with at least ",taxon_target," species.")))
  }
}

if (group == 4){
  
  print(p(paste0(proportion_met_target*100,"% of recorders achieved the recent challenge!")))
}


```

## ðŸŽ¯ Your challenge

This week, try to record a species list with at least `r taxon_target` species per list. Every extra species you record makes a big difference in our efforts to track biodiversity.

## Thanks!

Thank you for contributing to biodiversity monitoring!
