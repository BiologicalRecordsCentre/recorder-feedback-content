# Hello `r params$user_name`!

## Why record species 'lists'?

Recording as many species as possible provides scientists with valuable insights into the biodiversity of a given area. When we talk about species 'lists', we're referring to documenting more than just one or two striking or easily noticeable species—it's about observing and recording as many different species as you can find in a location.

`r challenge_message`

```{r plot}
# Records per day plot for the past 7 days
ggplot(species_per_day_week, aes(x = date, y = n_species)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#92A41A") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Length of longest list")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = function(x) unique(floor(pretty(seq(min(x), (max(x) + 1) * 1.1)))))+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = 'day', 
              date_labels = '%a')+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5,alpha= 0)+
  theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
```

## Your Challenge for This Week!



Try adding **just one more species** per visit! Taking an extra moment to check your surroundings could reveal more plants, birds, or insects. 

**Quick Tip:** Before submitting, look around—are there any species you might have missed?

## Why Does This Matter?

Recording complete lists helps scientists and conservationists **better understand biodiversity.** The more species you log per visit, the more valuable your data becomes! 🌍

## Ready to Try?

Next time you're out, challenge yourself to **record just one extra species**. It makes a big difference!
