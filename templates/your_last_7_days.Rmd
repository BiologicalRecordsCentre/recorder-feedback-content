# Hello `r params$user_name`!

Welcome to `r weekdays(current_date)`'s Nature Diary for the past 7 days. Let’s dive into the highlights of your recording journey. 🌍✨

## Your Activity

In the past 7 days you recorded on `r n_days_week` day`r if(n_days_week!=1){"s"}` submitting a total of `r n_records_week` records. You recorded `r n_species_week` different species. 

```{r}

if (n_records_week>0){
  text1 <- paste0("Your top species sightings included: ",paste0(head(species_names_week,5),collapse = ", "),". Wow!")
} else {
  text1 <- "You haven't recorded anything this week, what might you see next?"
}

p(text1)

```



Here’s how your activity shaped up through the week:

```{r plot}
# Records per day plot for the past 7 days
ggplot(records_per_day_week, aes(x = date, y = number_of_records)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#92A41A") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Number of records")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = function(x) unique(floor(pretty(seq(min(x), (max(x) + 1) * 1.1)))))+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = 'day', 
              date_labels = '%a')+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5,alpha= 0)+
  theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
```
