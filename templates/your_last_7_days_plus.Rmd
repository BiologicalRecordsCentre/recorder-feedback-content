# Hello `r params$user_name`!

Welcome to `r weekdays(current_date)`'s Nature Diary for the past 7 days. Let‚Äôs dive into the highlights of your recording journey. üåç‚ú® This email contains content generated by AI and therefore might feature inaccuracies or errors.

## Your Activity

```{r}

text0 <- paste0(
  "In the past 7 days (",
  Sys.Date()-7,
  " to ",
  Sys.Date()-1,
  ") you recorded on ",
  n_days_week," day",
  if(n_days_week!=1){"s"},
  " submitting a total of ",
  n_records_week,
  " records. You recorded ",
  n_species_week
)

text05 <- paste0("The weather was: ",history,".")

if (n_records_week>0){
  text1 <- paste0("Your top species sightings included: ",paste0(head(species_names_week,30),collapse = ", "),". Wow!")
} else {
  text1 <- "You haven't recorded anything this week, what might you see next?"
}

text_full <- call_llm(paste("Rephrase this, adding additional ecology information, if they have not recorded then do not mention other species they might see: ",text0,text05,text1))

cat(text_full)

# 
# call_llm(paste("Rephrase this, adding additional ecology information, don't make recommendations: ","In the past 7 days you recorded on 1 day submitting a total of 1 records. You recorded 1 different species. Your top species sightings included: Aix galericulata"))
# 
# call_llm(paste("Rephrase this, adding additional ecology information, don't make recommendations: ","In the past 7 days you recorded on 1 day submitting a total of 1 records. You recorded 1 different species. Your top species sightings included: Gomphus vulgatissimus."))
# 
# call_llm(paste("Rephrase this, adding additional ecology information, don't make recommendations: ","In the past 7 days you recorded on 4 days submitting a total of 34 records. You recorded 27 different species.Your top species sightings included: Episyrphus balteatus, Drosophila suzukii, Melanostoma scalare, Meliscaeva auricollis, Myathropa florea."))

```



Here‚Äôs how your activity shaped up through the week:

```{r plot}
# Records per day plot for the past 7 days
ggplot(records_per_day_week, aes(x = date, y = number_of_records)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#92A41A") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Number of records")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = function(x) unique(floor(pretty(seq(min(x), (max(x) + 1) * 1.1)))))+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = 'day', 
              date_labels = '%a')+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5,alpha= 0)+
  theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
```

## What Next?

```{r}
call_llm(
  paste0(
    "You previously provided this information to the recorder: ",
    text_full,
    ". The weather next week will be:",
    forecast,
    ". Please make some helpful recommendations of some recording activity they could do in the next week."
  )
) %>% cat()
