# Hello `r params$user_name`!

This is an example showing how different text/visual elements can be generated in an email.

## Use precalculated values/strings using inline R code

You made `r n_records` records of `r n_species` species!

These were `r paste0(species_names,collapse = ", ")`.

## Use precalculated values for generating insight

Other recorders made on average `r params$bg_computed_objects$mean_n_records` records of an average of `r params$bg_computed_objects$mean_n_species` species!

## Print tables using knitr::kable()

Your most recent records

```{r table}
params$user_data %>% 
  arrange(desc(date)) %>% 
  select(Species = species,Date = date) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Add plots through {ggplot2}

Here's a plot of your recent recording activity from `r first(records_per_day$date)` to `r last(records_per_day$date)`.

```{r plot}
ggplot(records_per_day,aes(x = date,y = number_of_records))+
  geom_col(fill = "#92A41A")+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)+
  labs(x = "Date",y = "Number of records")
```

## Add static maps with {ggspatial}

Here are your `r n_records` records plotted on a map.

```{r map}
user_data_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(params$user_data,coords =c("longitude","latitude"),crs = 4326)
bg_data_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(params$bg_data,coords =c("longitude","latitude"),crs = 4326)

ggplot() +
  ggspatial::annotation_map_tile(zoomin = -1,progress = "none") + # loads background map tiles from a tile source
  ggspatial::annotation_spatial(bg_data_sf,colour = "black")+
  ggspatial::layer_spatial(user_data_sf,colour = "red")
  
```

## Include images

Here is an image inserted using markdown. Use this for generic graphics/branding/logos etc.

![](https://irecord.org.uk/sites/default/files/irecord_logo.png)

And here is an image inserted using R code.

```{r image, out.width=400}
#include an image from a url within R code. This gives you options to provide a caption or other chunk option (see: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), 
#This also provides ways to include an image based off a url that is stored in user_data in order to show the user the image of their record
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Peacock_butterfly_%28Aglais_io%29_2.jpg/220px-Peacock_butterfly_%28Aglais_io%29_2.jpg")
```


## Buttons and links

Links can be done using markdown syntax such as [this is a link](https://www.irecord.org.uk)

Buttons in emails are not as straightforward as you might think, here's a way to do it in R.

```{r links}
url = "https://www.irecord.org.uk"
div(style="margin: auto;width: 100%;text-align: center;",
      a("Click here", 
        href=url,
        style ="font-size: 18px; color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; background-color: #92A41A; border-top: 12px solid #92A41A; border-bottom: 12px solid #92A41A; border-right: 18px solid #92A41A; border-left: 18px solid #92A41A; display: inline-block;")
    )
```
